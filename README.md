For use with https://github.com/typemytype/drawBotRoboFontExtension

## Usage

1. Open one of the scripts in the Drawbot extension
2. Run it

It should export all glyphs to a folder next to the UFO! 

You may need to slightly edit the scripts to do what you want, but this hopefully, this is a handy start!
